# LCU API Generator
Automatically generates LCU classes from LCU's swagger.json file

This is supposed to generate always up-to-date classes to interface with an actual LCU library, like https://github.com/pipe01/LCU.NET.

You can check out sample files generated by this tool under `/Sample output`. The code in the `ToInclude.cs` file are meant to always be present alongside the generated files.
